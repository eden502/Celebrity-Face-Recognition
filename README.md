# Celebrity-Face-Recognition

For this exercise we were tasked with the following:
1. Implement a CNN using VGG16 architechture on our own - without using pytorch.
2. Train our model to predict face recognition from a custom dataset which we created in a previous task - 13 classes of celebrity faces - 20 images each.
3. Re-train 5 torchvision models that were already trained on ImageNet datasets for facial recognition.
4. Ensamble those models to create a better prediction.
